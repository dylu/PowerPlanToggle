# PowerPlanToggle Readme

_PowerPlanToggle_ is a tool for [Rainmeter](http://rainmeter.net/).
It's intended for use as an overlay to help Windows (10) users toggle/switch between their various power plans.


### Installation

Make sure Rainmeter is installed on your computer.
Detailed instructions to do so may be found [here](http://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/installing-rainmeter)
--
There is currently no .rmskin package for this module, so you will need to copy this base folder over to your Rainmeter skins folder, and initialize the skin with the Rainmeter's own manage tool.


### Background

Windows 10 added many features, but eliminated the ability to quickly toggle between various power plans directly from the icon tray.

This skin allows you to toggle between various power options.


### Usage

TODO: The actual app, and how to use it.  (Likely useing powercfg.)
